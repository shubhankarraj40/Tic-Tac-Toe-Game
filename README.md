<p>Tic tac toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking the grid with either an X or an O, aiming to be the first to get three of their symbols in a row. This can be achieved horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game is simple but requires strategic thinking, as players must anticipate their opponent's moves to block them while creating their own winning path. Often, games end in a draw if both players use optimal strategies. Tic tac toe is a fun and quick game suitable for all ages.</p>
